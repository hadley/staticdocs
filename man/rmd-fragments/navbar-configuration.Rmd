By default, the top navbar will contain links to:

-   "Get Started", if you have an article with the same name as the package (e.g., `vignettes/pkgdown.Rmd`).
-   The reference index.
-   Articles (i.e., vignettes, if present).
-   News (if present).
-   An icon linking to the source repository.

You can override (and even remove) these defaults with the `navbar` field.
It has two primary components: `structure` and `components`.
These components interact in a somewhat complicated way, but the complexity allows you to make minor tweaks to part of the navbar while relying on pkgdown to automatically generate the rest.

The `structure` defines the layout of the navbar, i.e. the order of the components, and whether they're right aligned or left aligned.
You can use this component to change the order of the default components, remove some default components and add your own components.

```yaml
navbar:
 structure:
   left:  [intro, reference, articles, tutorials, news]
   right: [github]
```

The `components` describes the appearance of each element in the navbar.
It uses the same syntax as [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html#site-navigation).
The following YAML snippet illustrates some of the most important features.

```yaml
navbar:
 components:
   articles:
    text: Articles
    menu:
    - text: Category A
    - text: Title A1
      href: articles/a1.html
    - text: Title A2
      href: articles/a2.html
    - text: -------
    - text: "Category B"
    - text: Title B1
      menu:
      - text: "Sub-category B11"
        href: articles/b11.html
    twitter:
      icon: "fab fa-twitter fa-lg"
      href: https://twitter.com/hadleywickham
      aria-label: "twitter account"
```

Components can contain sub-`menu`s with headings (indicated by missing `href`) and separators (indicated by a bunch of `-`).
You can also use `icon`s from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).
When using icons with no text, for accessibility it's best practice to include an `aria-label` for screenreader users.

This yaml would override the default "articles" component, and add a new "twitter" component.
Unless you explicitly mention new components in the `structure` they'll be added to the far right of the left menu.

You can also customize the color scheme of the navbar by using the [`type` and `bg` parameters](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/#color-schemes):

```yaml
navbar:
  type: dark
  bg: primary
```

will produce a navbar with a dark background of the primary color (defined by Bootstrap default, a Bootswatch theme, or bslib variable cf `vignette("customization", package ="pkgdown")`)
