You can customise the top navbar with the `navbar` field.
It's made up of two pieces: `structure`, which defines the overall layout, and `components`, which defines what each piece looks like.
This organisation makes it easy to mix and match the pkgdown defaults with your own customisations.

This is the default structure:

``` yaml
navbar:
  structure:
    left:  [intro, reference, articles, tutorials, news]
    right: [search, github]
```

These there are six built-in components:

-   `intro`: "Get Started", which links to a vignette with the same name as the package.
-   `reference`, if there are any `.Rd` files.
-   `articles`, if there are any vignettes or articles.
-   `tutorials`, if there any tutorials.
-   `news`, if `NEWS.md` exists.
-   `github`, a link to the source repository (with an icon), if it can be automatically determined from the `DESCRIPTION`.

You can use the `structure` field to reorganise the navbar without changing the default contents:

``` yaml
navbar:
  structure:
    left:  [search]
    right: [reference, articles]
```

You can use `components` to override the default content.
The following yaml overrides the default articles menu:

``` yaml
navbar:
 components:
   articles:
    text: Articles
    menu:
    - text: Category A
    - text: Title A1
      href: articles/a1.html
    - text: Title A2
      href: articles/a2.html
    - text: -------
    - text: "Category B"
    - text: Article B1
      href: articles/b1.html
```

Components uses the same syntax as [RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html#site-navigation) menus.
Components can contain sub-`menu`s with headings (indicated by missing `href`) and separators (indicated by a bunch of `-`).
You can also use `icon`s from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).
When using icons instead of text, also supply `aria-label` for screenreader users.

To add a new component to the navbar, you need to modify both `structure` and `components`.
For example, the following yaml adds a new "twitter" component that appears to the left of the github icon.

``` yaml
navbar:
  structure:
    right: [twitter, github]
  components:
    twitter:
      icon: fa-twitter
      href: http://twitter.com/hadleywickham
      aria-label: Twitter
```

You can also customise the colour scheme of the navbar by using the [`type` and `bg` parameters](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/#color-schemes).
See `vignette("customise")` for more details.
