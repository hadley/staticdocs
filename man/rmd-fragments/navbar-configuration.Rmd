You can customise the navigation bar that appears at the top of the page with the `navbar` field.
It's made up of two pieces: `structure`, which defines the overall layout, and `components`, which defines what each piece looks like.
This organisation makes it easy to mix and match pkgdown defaults with your own customisations.

This is the default structure:

``` yaml
navbar:
  structure:
    left:  [intro, reference, articles, tutorials, news]
    right: [search, github]
```

It makes use of the the six built-in components:

-   `intro`: "Get Started", which links to a vignette or article with the same name as the package[^dots].
-   `reference`, if there are any `.Rd` files.
-   `articles`, if there are any vignettes or articles.
-   `tutorials`, if there any tutorials.
-   `news`, if `NEWS.md` exists.
-   `search`, the search box (see `vignette("search")` for more details).
-   `github`, a link to the source repository (with an icon), if it can be automatically determined from the `DESCRIPTION`.

[^dots]: Note that dots (`.`) in the package name need to be replaced by hyphens (`-`) in the vignette filename to be recognized as the intro. That means for a
    package `foo.bar` the intro needs to be named `foo-bar.Rmd`.

You can use the `structure` field to reorganise the navbar without changing the default contents:

``` yaml
navbar:
  structure:
    left:  [search]
    right: [reference, articles]
```

You can use `components` to override the default content.
For example, this yaml provides a custom articles menu:

``` yaml
navbar:
 components:
   articles:
    text: Articles
    menu:
    - text: Category A
    - text: Title A1
      href: articles/a1.html
    - text: Title A2
      href: articles/a2.html
    - text: -------
    - text: "Category B"
    - text: Article B1
      href: articles/b1.html
```

Components uses the same syntax as [RMarkdown menus](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html#site-navigation).
The elements of `menu` can be:

-   A link (`text` + `href`)

-   A heading (just `text`)

-   A separator (`text: ——–`)

Instead of text, you can also use the name of an `icon`s from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery).
You should also provide a textual description in the `aria-label` field for screenreader users.

To add a new component to the navbar, you need to modify both `structure` and `components`.
For example, the following yaml adds a new "twitter" component that appears to the left of the github icon.

``` yaml
navbar:
  structure:
    right: [twitter, github]
  components:
    twitter:
      icon: fa-twitter
      href: http://twitter.com/hadleywickham
      aria-label: Twitter
```

Finally, you can add arbitrary HTML to three locations in the navbar:

```yaml
template:
  includes:
    before_title: <!-- inserted before the package title in the header ->
    before_navbar: <!-- inserted before the navbar links -->
    after_navbar: <!-- inserted after the navbar links -->
```

These includes will appear on all screen sizes, and will not be collapsed into the the navbar drop down.

You can also customise the colour scheme of the navbar by using the `type` and `bg` parameters. See above for details.
