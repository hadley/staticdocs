By default, the sidebar is automatically populated with the following elements (in order): `r pkgdown:::code_commas(pkgdown:::default_sidebar_structure())`.
We shall first explain their creation, then how to tweak them.

-   `links`: The sidebar links are automatically generated by inspecting the `URL` and `BugReports` fields of the `DESCRIPTION`.
    If your package is developed on GitHub, you can use `usethis::use_github_links()` to populate these fields.

    You can add additional links with a subsection called `links`, which should contain a list of `text` + `href` elements:

```yaml
home:
  links:
  - text: Link text
    href: https://website.com
  - text: Roadmap
    href: /roadmap.html
```

-   `license`: Licensing information if `LICENSE`/`LICENCE` or `LICENSE.md`/`LICENCE.md` files are present.

-   `community`: Community information is linked in the side bar using the `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files, if present.

-   `citation`: Citation information from a `inst/CITATION` file is linked in the sidebar to the [authors page](https://testthat.r-lib.org/authors.html).

-   `authors`: Author information from `DESCRIPTION`, see the dedicated section.

-   `dev`: Development status badges found in `README.md`/`index.md`.
    pkgdown identifies badges in three ways:

    -   Any image-containing links between `<!-- badges: start -->` and `<!-- badges: end -->`, as e.g. created by `usethis::use_readme_md()` or `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`. 
    There should always be an empty line after the `<!-- badges: end -->` line.
    If you divide badges into paragraphs, make sure to add an empty line before the `<!-- badges: end -->` line.

    -   Any image-containing links within `<div id="badges"></div>`.

    -   Within the first paragraph, if it only contains image-containing links.

-   `toc`: Not added by default (see below), a table of contents for the README.
