You can customise the footer with the `footer` field.
It's made up of two pieces: `structure`, which defines the overall layout, and `components`, which defines what each piece looks like.
This organisation makes it easy to mix and match the pkgdown defaults with your own customisations.

This is the default structure:

``` yaml
footer:
  structure: 
    left: developed_by
    right: built_with
```

Which uses two of the three built-in components:

-   `developed_by`, a sentence describing the main authors of the package. (See `?build_home` if you want to tweak *which* authors appear in the footer.)
-   `built_with`, a sentence advertising pkgdown.
-   `package`, the name of the package.

You can override these defaults with the `footer` field.
The example below puts the authors' information on the right along with a legal disclaimer, and puts the pkgdown link on the left.

``` yaml
footer:
  structure: 
    left: pkgdown
    right: [developed_by, legal]
  components:
    legal: Provided without **any warranty**.
```

Each side is pasted into a single string (separated by `" "`) and then converted from markdown to HTML.
