You can customise the top navbar with the `footer` field.

By default, the footer is automatically populated with:

-   The names of the authors on the left.
-   A link to the pkgdown website on the right.

You can override these defaults with the `footer` field.
The example below puts the authors information on the right together with a legal disclaimer, and puts pkgdown on the left.

``` yaml
footer:
  left:
    structure: [pkgdown]
  right:
    structure: [authors, legal]
    components:
      legal: Provided without ***any warranty***.
```

Like the navbar and sidebar, you can control both the structure and the components.
Unlike the navbar or sidebar, the components of the footer are just pasted together into a string that converted to HTML and insert in the document.

See `?build_home` if you want to tweak *which* authors appear in the footer.
