By default, the footer is automatically populated with:

-   The names of the [authors `authors`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/reference/build_home.html#yaml-config-authors), on the left.
-   A reference to pkgdown `pkgdown`, on the right.

The example below puts the authors information on the right together with a legal disclaimer, and puts pkgdown on the left.

```yaml
footer:
 left:
   structure: [pkgdown]
 right:
   structure: [authors, legal]
   components:
     legal: Provided without ***any warranty***.
```

Like the navbar and side, you can control both the structure and the components.
Unlike the navbar or sidebar, the components of the footer are just pasted together into a string that converted to HTML and insert in the document.
