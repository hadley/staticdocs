You can change the order of sidebar components: `r pkgdown:::code_commas(pkgdown:::default_sidebar_structure())`; you can add a README table of contents `toc`, you can add custom components.
The example below creates a sidebar whose only components will be the authors section, a custom section, a table of contents for the README and a Dev Status section if there are badges.
The `text` will be treated as Markdown.

```yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    structure: [authors, custom, toc, dev]
    components:
      custom:
        title: Funding
        text: We are *grateful* for funding!
```

Alternatively, you can provide a ready-made sidebar HTML:

```yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    html: path-to-sidebar.html
```

Finally, you can completely remove the sidebar.

```yaml
home:
  sidebar: FALSE
```
