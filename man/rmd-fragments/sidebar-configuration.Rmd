You can customise the homepage sidebar with the `home.sidebar` field.
It's made up of two pieces: `structure`, which defines the overall layout, and `components`, which defines what each piece looks like.
This organisation makes it easy to mix and match the pkgdown defaults with your own customisations.

This is the default structure:

``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    structure: [links, license, community, citation, authors, dev]
```

These are drawn from seven built-in components:

-   `links`: automated links generated from `URL` and `BugReports` `DESCRIPTION` fields plus manual links from the `home.links` field:

    ``` yaml
    home:
      links:
      - text: Link text
        href: https://website.com
      - text: Roadmap
        href: /roadmap.html
    ```

-   `license`: Licensing information if `LICENSE`/`LICENCE` or `LICENSE.md`/`LICENCE.md` files are present.

-   `community`: links to to `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, etc.

-   `citation`: link to package citation information. Uses either `inst/CITATION` or, if absent, information from the `DESCRIPTION`.

-   `authors`: selected authors from the `DESCRIPTION`.

-   `dev`: development status badges found in `README.md`/`index.md`.

-   `toc`: a table of contents for the README (not shown by default).

You can also add your own components, where `text` is markdown text:

``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    structure: [authors, custom, toc, dev]
    components:
      custom:
        title: Funding
        text: We are *grateful* for funding!
```

Alternatively, you can provide a ready-made sidebar HTML:

``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    html: path-to-sidebar.html
```

Or completely remove it:

``` yaml
home:
  sidebar: FALSE
```
